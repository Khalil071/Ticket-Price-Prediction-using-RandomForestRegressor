Ticket Price Prediction using RandomForestRegressor

Overview

This project builds a machine learning model using the RandomForestRegressor algorithm to predict ticket prices based on various factors such as date, location, demand, and other relevant features. The model is trained on historical ticket pricing data to provide accurate price predictions.

Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Training a RandomForestRegressor model

Hyperparameter tuning for optimization

Model evaluation using performance metrics

Predicting ticket prices based on input features

Dataset

The dataset includes historical ticket price data with features such as:

Event type

Date and time

Location

Demand trends

Seat category

Other pricing factors

Technologies Used

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib/Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ticket-price-prediction.git
cd ticket-price-prediction

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Model Architecture

The model follows these steps:

Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.

Feature Selection – Selecting relevant features for better predictions.

Training RandomForestRegressor – Training the model with optimal hyperparameters.

Evaluation – Using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Usage

Train the model:

python train.py

Predict ticket prices:

python predict.py --event "concert" --location "New York" --date "2025-06-15"

Evaluate the model:

python evaluate.py

Results

The model achieves accurate ticket price predictions using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Feature importance analysis

Future Improvements

Incorporating real-time data sources for dynamic predictions

Experimenting with other regression models like XGBoost or Gradient Boosting

Adding sentiment analysis from social media to gauge demand
